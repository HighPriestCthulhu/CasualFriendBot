This is bot that grabs messages from reddit, then throws them into a matchmaking algorithm to pair the message senders with similar people based on their post history.

If you steal this code please be nice

TODO

- Send messages to participants //done 2018.01.30
- Create and send list of similarities to participants [subreddits they share]
- Move bot to RPi so I don't have to run it from my main computer and therefor eliminate downtime from me being lazy
- Make bot stream capable
- Professionalize code
